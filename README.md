# Driving Growth: Analyzing E-commerce Sales Data for Strategic Decisions
## Problem Statement
The e-commerce platform faces challenges in leveraging its vast amount of user and product interaction data to drive strategic business decisions. Despite having detailed information on user profiles, product details, and interactions, the platform struggles to effectively analyze this data to understand customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing trends. This lack of actionable insights hinders the platform's ability to optimize its sales strategies, improve customer engagement, and increase overall revenue.
